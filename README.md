# IntelliMake.org

Static marketing site for IntelliMake. Styles are built with Tailwind CSS and a small custom layer for gradients and glass effects.

## Getting started

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Generate CSS (single build):

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

   or watch for changes during development:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

The compiled stylesheet is written to `assets/tailwind.css` and referenced from `index.html`.
